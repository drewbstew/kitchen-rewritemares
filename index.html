  [City name], a town [something about prominent landmark / a slice of suburbia / everyland Ameritown]. And right in [prominent location] is [restaurant name].
  [restaurant name] is owned by [owner], who [won it in a card game / bought it with spouse, neither of whom had restaurant experience / is the third generation owner who wishes (s)he were dead]
  Random cuts of owner cooking / walking through floor, cut with sappy music behind, and occasional still frames of old looking shit.
  Then things turned for the worse... but owner is still obviously delusional. Sometimes sad, but still super delusional.
  Staff fills in gaps: (empty restaurant, angry staff/owner, ugly/horrible food, dirty)
  The restaurant will be swallowed into the pit of hell without Chef Ramsey. Literally he is the only person in the known or unknown universe who can save this restaurant, family, and
  possibly America.
