  meet owner (and trouble staff), make rude comment about food, find something dirty
  ominous question: can they survive?
  </div>

  <div id="intro-music"></div>
  <div id="owner-intro"></div>
  [City name], a town [something about prominent landmark / a slice of suburbia / everyland Ameritown]. And right in [prominent location] is [restaurant name].
  [restaurant name] is owned by [owner], who [won it in a card game / bought it with spouse, neither of whom had restaurant experience / is the third generation owner who wishes (s)he were dead]
  Random cuts of owner cooking / walking through floor, cut with sappy music behind, and occasional still frames of old looking shit.
  Then things turned for the worse... but owner is still obviously delusional. Sometimes sad, but still super delusional.
  Staff fills in gaps: (empty restaurant, angry staff/owner, ugly/horrible food, dirty) [these things will always be addressed by Gordon]
  The restaurant will be swallowed into the pit of hell without Chef Ramsey. Literally he is the only person in the known or unknown universe who can save this restaurant, family, and
  possibly America.
  <div id="enter-ramsey">
    Ramsey comments on outside decor - paint, sign, etc.
    Ramsey walks in, talks to host, but makes rude, often nonsequitor comment about the decor that doesn't really fit which is why they never get the joke.
    Ramsey talks to the host, who is really confident that he's going to love everything, because they've definitely seen this show before and that always happens.
      -if decor is an issue, the owner loves the decor! they/their dumbass kid/some fuckwit designed it, so ramsey should stick to food.
    Ramsey orders an app or 2, 2 entrees, maybe a dessert if he give a fuck.
      -cut to owner: Ramsey is going to love the food!
      -cut to Ramsey: continues making fun of decor, talks with waiter/waitress about how shitty the restaurant is
    Food comes out; it looks like cat balls.
      -as food is coming out, staff/chef may comment that the food blows but the owner and/or incompetent chef like it that way
    Ramsey comments how the food [looks shit/is bland/is overcooked/is raw/is a mish-mash of random shit]
      -owner is angry/couldn't care less
    Ramsey greets each of the kitchen staff politely, then tears them to fucking pieces
      -embarrassing!!
    let's start from the top [recaps each, embellishes]
    I'm coming back later to get the taste of your failure out of my mouth. you better improve on dinner service, even though it's obvious you won't, because...
  </div>
  <div id="dinner-service-1">
    Ramsey is in [city name], which means this shithole restaurant is busier than shit! And the house is full of hungry customers waiting for food. They all order apps.
    Gordon sees some whack shit in the kitchen [no communication in the kitchen / dirty shit everywhere / weird equipment / fighting]
    It takes [1-60 millenia] for anything to come out of the kitchen.
    When it does, all the food that comes out is terrible and gets sent back. The customers are all seen complaining, many of whom do so with obviously fed producer lines they can't read.
    Shit spirals out of control in the kitchen as Gordon needles people relentlessly until they lash out and either fight, leave, or just causes Gordon to leave.
  </div>
  <div id="post-dinner-service-1">
    Gordon says everyone is the worst at all times about all things. The few people who makes comments Gordon agrees with are praised as geniuses.
      -oftentimes, Gordon will also go into the kitchen and point out all the shit that's laughably kept in poor condition / too long / against health regulations / etc.
    The owner and Gordon clash for a bit, then Gordon leaves.
  </div>
  <div id="day2-morning">
    We need to fill time, so Gordon makes small changes first. Usually a small menu change that's easy to make because the current chefs are incompetent. He also gives the owner or manager
    something new to do to watch them struggle for a while.
  </div>
  <div id="dinner-service-2">
    optional! may not happen. could be replaced by emotional exposition about how they'll lose the restaurant / the house / the family / the farm.
    if not present, also needs Gordon bringing everyone together under his counsel.
    IF SERVICE: bring emotional shit into it then and afterward.
  </div>
  <div id="makeover">
    new restaurant - changes that are all super modern and sorta hipster but all sort of looks the same. the owner repeats the same thing that the producer feeds them. Gordon = best.
    New menu - "this menu is unlike anything in town. push the crab. we will make money"
  </div>
  <div id="dinner-service-3">
    kitchen is full again, busy as fuck. minor problems at the beginning, mirrors problems from before. then Gordon gives a peptalk and they rally.
  </div>
  <div id="post-service-3">
    You all didn't give up, you'll all amazing for making my amazing food passably. You people with emotional stuff either went through them, or didn't, but did so in a light where
    it is clearly not my fault.
    You all have a bright future, except the ones I don't like, who don't. Good bye.
    As Gordon leaves, his back faces the camera so he can later record his voice saying something witty that linked back to an earlier negative moment in the episode.
